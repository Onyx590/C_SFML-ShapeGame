#  Foundational Game for Game Engine


In this project, we will be building a small game prototype that will set the foundation our game engine. This project has many parts. For example, it has its own Vector2 class implemented.
 Also, it has an Entity class that is managed by the Entity Manager class. It also has a separate Game header file that takes care of the main functionalities of the game.
 The libraries used in this project are SFML for rendering and IMGUI for GUI.
